# Express Sign In With Google

> Inspired by [google-onetap-signin-server](https://github.com/Zensynthium/google-onetap-server)

This is a basic example to receive POST request from Sign in with Google and verify google credential.
It should work with [Vue Sign in with Google](https://github.com/Parkerhiphop/Vue-Sign-In-With-Google).
